# Misspell
This is a JavaScript reverse spellchecker. It takes words and screws up the spelling and capitalisation.

## Usage
Include `misspell.js` in your project with a `<script>` tag or via `npm install misspell`. Then you can require it and use it right away!

```
var misspell = require("misspell") // if you haven't included it with a script tag

var misspelledText = misspell(text, capitalisation[, capsTypes, mispellPercent])
// text: the string you would like to process
// capitalisation: boolean, set this to true or false depending on if you want the capitalisation to be changed.
// capsTypes (optional): an array of the capitalisation modes you want to enable. of the array of modes you supply, a random mode will be chosen. if you don't supply an array of specific modes, a random mode will be chosen out of every possible mode.
    // LIST OF CAPITALISATION MODES
    // mode 1: jaden smith mode, capitalises the first letter of each word in the string
    // mode 2: random jaden smith mode, sometimes capitalises the first letter of randomly picked words from the string
    // mode 3: uppercase mode, makes whole string uppercase
    // mode 4: lowercase mode, makes whole string lowercase
    // mode 5: totally screwed up mode, each character is randomly made uppercase or lowercase
    // mode 6: "tumblr" mode, begins a string normally and eventually at a random place goES INTO ALL CAPS AND CONTINUES TO BE ALL CAPS UNTIL THE END OF THE STRING
// an example of a value you can supply for capsTypes is [1, 3, 5], which only allows jaden smith mode, uppercase mode, and totally screwed up mode.
// misspellPercent (optional): percent likelihood of messing up with spelling.
```

You can also play around with `misspell.js` like a CLI. Run it with `node` and pass the same arguments you'd pass to it as a function in the same order and it'll pipe out the result.

## Reverse Spellcheck Dictionary
Part of what made this project possible is the Wikipedia [machine readable list of common misspellings.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines) I wrote a script to take that and make it into a nice JSON file, which sits in the folder `reverse-spellcheck/`. Feel free to use it to serialize your own files.

## Close Letters On Keyboard JSON File
This is a JSON file that includes each letter on a QWERTY keyboard and an array with the surrounding letters. Feel free to use it anyplace you like.

## Using Misspell On The Client Side
If you plan to use Misspell in a web based HTML document, it is important to include the failsafe file `misspell-dependencies.js` in a place accessible by Misspell. This is in place because Misspell needs the files `keyboard-close.json` and `reverse-spellcheck.json`, and while it tries to run an HTTP request to get them, it doesn't always work due to CORS, disorganization, and many other potential issues.

## License
The reverse spellcheck JSON file is under public domain. I didn't think I'd need to copyright it considering I didn't really make it myself, I just formatted it right.
